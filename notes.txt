Bencode (pronounced Bee-encode) is a serialization format used in the BitTorrent protocol. It is used in torrent files and in communication between trackers and peers.

Bencode supports four data types:

strings
integers
arrays
dictionaries
In this stage, we'll focus on decoding strings.

Strings are encoded as <length>:<contents>. For example, the string "hello" is encoded as "5:hello".
Integers are encoded as i<number>e. For example, 52 is encoded as i52e and -52 is encoded as i-52e.
