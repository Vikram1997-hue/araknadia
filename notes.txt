Bencode (pronounced Bee-encode) is a serialization format used in the BitTorrent protocol. 
It is used in torrent files and in communication between trackers and peers.
BASICALLY: is the encoding used by the peer-to-peer file sharing system BitTorrent for storing and transmitting loosely structured data.

Bencode supports four data types:
  - strings
  - integers
  - arrays
  - dictionaries (associative arrays)

Bencoding is most commonly used in torrent files, and as such is part of the BitTorrent specification. 

- Strings are encoded as <length>:<contents>. For example, the string "hello" is encoded as "5:hello".
- Integers are encoded as i<number>e. For example, 52 is encoded as i52e and -52 is encoded as i-52e.
- Lists are encoded as l<bencoded_elements>e. For example, ["hello", 52] would be encoded as l5:helloi52ee. Note that there are 
  no separators between the elements.
- A dictionary is encoded as d<key1><value1>...<keyN><valueN>e. <key1>, <value1> etc. correspond to the bencoded keys & values. 
  The keys are sorted in lexicographical order and must be strings. For example, {"hello": 52, "foo":"bar"} would be encoded as
  d3:foo3:bar5:helloi52ee (note that the keys were reordered).


A torrent file (also known as a metainfo file) that contains metadata about files and folders to be distributed, and usually also a 
list of the network locations of trackers, which are computers that help participants in the system find each other and form efficient 
distribution groups called swarms. Torrent files normally have the extension .torrent.
  With the help of a torrent file, one can download small parts of the original file from computers that have already downloaded it. These 
"peers" allow for downloading of the file in addition to, or in place of, the primary server. A torrent file does not contain the content 
to be distributed; it only contains information about those files, such as their names, folder structure, sizes, and cryptographic hash values 
for verifying file integrity.
  MAIN ADVANTAGE OF TORRENT FILES: The torrent system has been created to ease the load on central servers, as instead of having individual 
clients fetch files from the server, torrent can crowd-source the bandwidth needed for the file transfer and reduce the time needed to 
download large files. Many free/freeware programs and operating systems, such as the various Linux distributions offer a torrent download 
option for users seeking the aforementioned benefits.

TORRENTING IS LEGAL. PIRACY IS NOT.
There's a difference.


contains a bencoded dictionary with the following keys and values:
- announce:
  URL to a "tracker", which is a central server that keeps track of peers participating in the sharing of a torrent.
- info: 
  A dictionary with keys:
  - length: size of the file in bytes, for single-file torrents
  - name: suggested name to save the file / directory as
  - piece length: number of bytes in each piece
  - pieces: concatenated SHA-1 hashes of each piece
  Note: .torrent files contain bytes that arenâ€™t valid UTF-8 characters. If the language you're using treats strings as a sequence of unicode characters (like Python's str), you'll need to use a byte sequence (like Python's bytes) instead.

Note: The info dictionary looks slightly different for multi-file torrents. For this challenge, we'll only implement support for single-file torrents.
